# PageRank
A project carried out with pyspark which aims at recoding Page Rank from scratch. 
I study 2 implementations (one (PageRank1.py) coded from scratch to understand each brick of the algorithm / another one with a faster approach is then studied (PageRank2.py)).
The small data set used is in PageRank3.txt (I choose a small one to get quick convergences)
